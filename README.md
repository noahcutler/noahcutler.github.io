Approx time to completion: 6 hrs

What worked:

     -Each page allows the user to access the other 2 pages
     -CSS class implemetations
     -circular image crop on icons for design purposes
     -passes all official W3C specs
   
What didn't work:

     -Had a little trouble with styling to get multiple elements on the same line
     -I wanted to add a hover feature that showed text (ex. "RESUME") when the user hovers over each image to allow for better usability/site navigation, but I could not figure out how to make it work in time.
     -I also wanted the icons to be on the left side of the screen in vertical orientation instead of horizontal at the top. Ideally, the icons would stay in the same place on the screen, following whereever the user scrolls (up/down only), and the hover function would work as well, but, alas, I could not figure that out either.
