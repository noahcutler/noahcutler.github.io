	<p class = "cntr"> My name is Noah Cutler and I am a sophomore at Tufts University. I am currently pursuing a BA with double major in International Relations (Security focus) and Chinese, as well as a minor in computer science. I hope to one day apply the knowledge gained from my majors and minor to a career in journalism.</p>
	<p class= "cntr">  My academic interests lie heavily in cybersecurity, both from a technological perspective and a public policy perspective. Outside of the class room, I am heavily involved in the music and journalism communities, playing in multiple bands and writing for the on campus political journal and music journal.</p>
